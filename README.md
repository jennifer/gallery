# Gallery

Collect websites for design inspiration. Submit a URL, tag the website's best elements, and take notes. The Gallery app takes a screenshot of the website and displays it in an image gallery. Mouse over each image (or tap on a touchscreen) to display title, tags, and notes. Click an image to edit the entry or to visit the website. Need a design idea? Filter the collection by elements and get inspired.

## Motivation

I often bookmark websites with unique and inspiring design elements. Over time, I collected dozens of bookmars that offered no visual preview of the website, and no context for why I had bookmarked it. I built this app to store my favorite websites - including an image, metadata, and notes for each - to use a source for design ideas in my own projects.
